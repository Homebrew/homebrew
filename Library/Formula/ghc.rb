# The GHC bindist can be installed into any prefix.
# Building from source takes a very, very long time, and requires the bindist anyway.
# For these reasons, the normal way to install this package should be to download the
# bindist and install it into our prefix. This way we can achieve fast installation
# without having to build bottles ourselves, and it works for any prefix.
# We maintain the option of building from source, for people who want to do so.
#
# This formula supports two versions of GHC: the version compatible with the latest
# Haskell Platform (the default) and the current stable version (use --current). Since
# H-P is released far less frequently than GHC, these are going to be different versions
# most of the time.
#
# For GHC 7.4.2, we force building from source because there is an important patch that
# needs to be applied. For this version, it is appropriate to have bottles as well.
# However, for future versions they will not be needed, saving us a lot of time.

# Since the bindist package is needed for both binary and source installations, it should
# be the main formula's download. However, previous versions of this formula had the
# source package as the main download. Because of name mangling, both end up being called
#Â "ghc-7.4.2.tar.bz2", which can cause a checksum mismatch when reinstalling. To make
# things easier for our users, this disables name mangling for those downloads.
