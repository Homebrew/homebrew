    Add the following to your bash_profile or zshrc to complete the install:

      . #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/etc/lowprofile

    and source the file to pick up the change.

    if you don't already have it in there feel free to add (if not lowprofile
    will append it for you):

      export AWS_PROFILE=default


    that's it lowprofile with take it from there!
    You can now switch AWS profiles simply by typing

      lowprofile activate-profile --profile new-profile

    EOS
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/lowprofile-#{version}", "--help"
  end
