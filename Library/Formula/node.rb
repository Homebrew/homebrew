        Homebrew has NOT installed npm. If you later install it, you should supplement
        your NODE_PATH with the npm module folder:
          #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/lib/node_modules

    else
      s += <<-EOS.undent
        Node.js v4 was installed with a patched version of npm (with node-gyp v3) which
        is required to build native modules with Node.js v4. It is not recommended to
        upgrade npm to a version that still ships with node-gyp v2.
      EOS

    if build.with? "icu4c"
      s += <<-EOS.undent

        Please note `icu4c` is built with a newer deployment target than Node and
        this may cause issues in certain usage. Node itself is built against the
        outdated `libstdc++` target, which is the root cause. For more information see:
          https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/7919

        If this is an issue for you, do `brew install node --without-icu4c`.
